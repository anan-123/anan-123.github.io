Cooperative human-human communication becomes challenging when restrictions such as difference in communication modality and limited time are imposed. We use the popular cooperative social game Pictionary as an online multimodal test bed to explore the dynamics of human-human interactions in such settings. As a part of our study, we identify attributes of player interactions that characterize cooperative gameplay. We found stable and role-specific playing style components that are independent of game difficulty. In terms of gameplay and the larger context of cooperative partially observable communication, our results suggest that too much interaction or unbalanced interaction negatively impacts game success. Additionally, the playing style components discovered via our analysis align with select player personality types proposed in existing frameworks for multiplayer games.
