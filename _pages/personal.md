When I’m not working, I love spending time at the beach and exploring foods from different cultures—trying something new is always exciting. I also enjoy painting in my free time; it’s a creative outlet that helps me unwind (you can see an example in the pic!). I occasionally dance or get in a good workout to stay active and energized. I also really enjoy watching Korean and Chinese dramas.
