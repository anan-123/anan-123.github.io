Hi there! I'm Anandhini Rajendran ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of agentic AI, large language models (LLMs), and computer vision.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Jio Platforms, where I optimized big data workflows using Spark and Hive, and enhanced content recommendation systemsâ€”cutting runtime by 61% through smart caching and performance tuning. I earned my Bachelor's degree from IIIT Hyderabad, with research focused on multimodal AI agents (leveraging tools like Stable Diffusion and DALLÂ·E) and Human-Computer Interaction.

My toolkit includes Python, C++, SQL, React, and big data systems, with hands-on experience in machine learning, NLP, and computer vision. Iâ€™m currently exploring opportunities in software engineering, AI, and data scienceâ€”especially roles where I can help design scalable, AI-driven solutions that make a real-world impact.

If you're working on something in that space or just want to connect, feel free to reach out ðŸ˜Š!
