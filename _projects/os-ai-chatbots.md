There have been major advances in natural language processing in the few years, particularly in developing and refining new network architectures like transformers, that allow chatbots to handle natural language input more robustly. In this talk, we’ll cover what the differences are between machine learning and rule-based approaches to building chatbots and when to use each. We’ll also quickly walk through what you need to know to start building your own AI chatbots using Rasa’s open source framework, as well as practical recommendations for improving any AI chatbot after deployment using conversation driven development.
