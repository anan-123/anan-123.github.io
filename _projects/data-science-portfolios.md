This project describes how to put together a data science portfolio that will help you stand out, different kinds of data science jobs and how to tailor your application to shine as a candidate.

I actually gave this project twice: [once in DC](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/254015586/) and [once in Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/events/254830800/).
